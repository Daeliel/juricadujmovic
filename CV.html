We have been in business for 40 years; employ 150 employees; and have over 600,000 readers and clients in the U.S. and overseas. However, in all my years in business, I have rarely employed or encountered an individual more skilled, talented and professional than Jurica Dujmović.

                        <p>"Jurica is a real pro when it comes to content marketing, social media marketing and journalism, and Web design. In fact, I have actually learned more about those topics from him than anyone else. He's one of those rare people you would hire for any job because you know he'd do it right. Juri is all about helping a company grow and improve, and he sets his sights on the big picture while knowing the small things that need to get done."</p>

At HedgeCoVest, Jurica performs numerous functions, including but not limited to preparing email campaigns, designing/reinventing company visuals, webinars, creating web pages, as well as traditional graphic assets, such as brochures and pop-ups. Jurica's attention to detail is impressive. Jurica's designs are not only visual and functional but he also makes sure the final product reflects both the values and brand of our organization. Jurica has a myriad of experience in graphic and web design with experience using graphic tablets, Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, After Effects, InDesign, and a variety of markup and programming languages.

                        <p>"Ridiculously enthusiastic" is the phrase that comes to mind whenever I talk about Jure. I had the opportunity to work with Jure while I was the Marketing Director at Weiss Ratings, and we hired him to work on several projects for us. What I was impressed by immediately was there are very few people who have the energy, excitement, and drive of Jure. It didn't matter what we needed, or when, or how many revisions were asked for, he was always eager, able, and full of creative ideas and ways to get things done. And even in the crush of the mounting stress and pressure that comes with extremely tight deadlines, Jure was always positive and enthusiastic. Always willing to do whatever it took to get the job done. Jure would be an invaluable asset to any team, and I highly recommend him."</p>
